 * Interface for objects that are interested in tracking schema change events in the cluster.

 * An implementation of this interface can be registered against a Cluster

 * <p/>
 * Note that the methods defined by this interface will be executed by internal driver threads, and are

 * calls in response to schema change events, it is strongly recommended to schedule them asynchronously
 * on a separate thread provided by our application code.
